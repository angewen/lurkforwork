- Pretty login page :D
- Meaningful text on all images
- Labels on all form inputs
- "alert" role for success/error alerts and toasts
- Ensured page is operable by keyboard
- aria-label for icon only buttons
- When you cant e.g. like a users post because you dont follow them, it will disable the button
  - Flows better than throwing an error
  - A tooltip is displayed to explain why it is disabled
  - This tooltip is focusable by screen readers
